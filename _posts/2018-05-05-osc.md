It is often, that configuration of the OpenStack connection in OTC is causing problems.
Therefore I have decided to make a small post on how should it be done effectively.

There are generally speaking 2 ways of doing that:
<!--excerpt-->
- environment variables
- configuration file

Until some time environment variables were the only way, but now there is a better way - configuration.
In order to show it's advantages it will be described here in details. For the reference you can look  [openstacksdk](https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/latest/user/config/configuration.html).

## Configuration

For the sake of security it is possible/suggested to split configuration in two parts: overall and secure

Main configuration file `clouds.yaml` should look this way:
```
clouds:
  otc: # this is just a name
    auth:
      auth_url: https://iam.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com:443/v3
      project_name: eu-de #required, since otherwise some APIs are not working
      user_domain_name: OTC00000000001000000XXX # Here is your domain name
    interface: public # also important
    identity_api_version: 3 # also important
    # private: yes # Usually not required,
    #     unless some tools based on python
    #     shade lib reject to work without public ip
```

Login information can be (or can be left in the main cloud.yaml file) stored in a separate file `secure.yaml`:
```
clouds:
  otc:  # this must match name from clouds.yaml
    auth:
      username: MY_USER_NAME
      password: MY_SECRET
    ak: MY_AK # not required, unless otcextensions are used
    sk: MY_SK # not required, unless otcextensions are used
```

**Note:** unless you have a tenant with multiple regions please avoid setting the region.
Since in the service catalog there is no identity service configuration for each region individually it will not be possible to establish connection.

Configuration files can be placed in one of the following locations:
* Current Directory
* ~/.config/openstack
* /etc/openstack - global configuration

## Usage

With the configuration set it is as easy as:
```
> openstack --os-cloud otc image list
> # or get the osc console for interactive mode
> openstack --os-cloud otc
(openstack)
```

Switching between clouds can be done by simply giving other variable value to the OS_CLOUD.

By exporting OS_CLOUD=otc it is also possible to achieve default connection:
```
> openstack image list
(openstack)
```

## OTC extensions

Further it is even possible to install OpenStackClient plugins to get access to extended functionality of the OpenTelekomCloud (project is currently in a heavy development phase [otcextensions](http://python-otcextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

The work on creating RPMs for different platforms is corrently in progress, so `pip` is a recommended way for now:

```
> sudo pip install otcextensions --upgrade
...
> openstack load balancer list
```
